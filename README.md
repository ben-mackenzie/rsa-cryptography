# rsa-cryptography
Performs 10-character encoding and decoding using RSA cryptography.

Purpose

    This program explores RSA encryption and its underlying principles, including primality, 
    managing large numbers, and file reading.

Input
    
    This program takes as inputs several numbers used for encryption and decryption, 
    and also encrypted messages.

Output

    The output of this program is a decoded and translated message.

Bugs or Implemented Test Cases; and, any theoretical follow-up

    A preliminary test message of 10 characters was used to build and test this program, 
    while a longer message with blank spaces and multiple cases was tested after.
